Best of all we are not using any custom CSS library for creating these animations, we are using optimized custom code behind the scene.

Following animation effects currently available:

* Fade
* Slide
* Bounce
* Zoom

## ✏️ Tweak Content Typography in Gutenberg WordPress

Now it is super easy to tweak your content Typography in Gutenberg WordPress Editor using the Editor Plus plugin. 😮

You can easily adjust the following font properties visually using the "Typography" panel available for content blocks.

* Font Weight
* Font Style
* Font Size
* Letter Spacing
* Line Height
* Color

And as Editor Plus allows you to tweak these options for Responsive and Hover, this makes it easier for you to adjust your typography for mobile & tablet differently.

## 💎 Add Icons anywhere (RichText) in Gutenberg Editor 💎

Need to insert an icon? Editor Plus brings icons integration that enables you to insert icons anywhere where you can insert text. You can add icons to paragraphs, headlines, buttons, or any other place where you can write text in the editor. Additionally, you can also apply a background color, add a border, and set border-radius to the icons. Currently, we've included Font Awesome and Icon Moon icon libraries, but, we may add more in the future.  

## 🌈 Add Nice SVG Shape Dividers in Gutenberg Editor 🌈

SVG shape dividers or separators add a nice visual effect to your section or content. Now you can easily add and customize it in Gutenberg WordPress Editor. Currently supported on the following blocks:

* Cover Block
* Columns Block & inner Column Block
* Group Block

As it is available for the Group block means you can simply group any block(s) content and add a shape divider to the group.

## 🦸‍♂️ Be a Pro - Copy & Paste Block Styles & Responsive Visual Editing 🦸‍♂️

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpJdJCuC5kQ

Starting with Editor Plus v1.6.0, now you can copy a block style and paste it to another block with a click quickly. You do not need to re-style the same thing again and again. 

This release also improved responsive editing features by synchronizing the responsive previewer window.

## Template and Pattern Library

Editor Plus now includes a template and pattern library that can be accessed by clicking the "Library" button in the menu bar of the editor. We provide a variety of templates and patterns to serve different use cases and are adding more templates every week.
Note: Editor Plus templates and patterns rely on blocks and styling applied by the Editor Plus plugin. If you uninstall Editor Plus, the templates and patterns will still display on your site, but the styling may be affected.  Additionally, stock images included in the templates are hosted on GutenbergHub.com. We recommend replacing the images or adding them to your media library directly.

## Privacy

Editor Plus uses a custom API to fetch templates and patterns from our growing library. To improve the service and stability we store logs which may contain the following:

* browser type
* referring site
* date and time of request
* category selection or search term
* anonymized IP address

API requests are only made when a user clicks on the Library button.
